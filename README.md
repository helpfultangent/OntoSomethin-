# # OntoSomethin-
This is the repository for the OntoSomethin' Hackathon Team for the ISGEO and iHARP Annual 2022 Workshop

# Goal of the OntoSomethin' Project: 
Create a Knowledge Management Registry (KMR) of Polar and Data Science resources to support the iHARP and ISGEO research communities. 
The KMR will Prioritize Spatio-temporal Materials for Education from the perspective of both AI and Polar Domains

# Activities: 
1) Set up and Initial Taxonomy or Framework to categorize and label entries in the registry. 
2) Identified possible collections of AI and educational materials


# iHARP KMT Taxonomy (preliminary)
Keywords or Labels used in Ontosoft entries: 

1. Categories 
- tool, - teaching material,- tutorial
2. domain problem 
- polar science
- ai/ml 
- data science 
 ice sheet melting, spatio-temporal, sea ice, etc.]
3. approach/method 
- quantitative
- qualitative
4. foundational Information 
5. data 
- benchmark 
- observational
6. model 
- empirical
- physics-based
7. Type resource
- dynamic 
- static
8. CI Resources 
9. expertise 
- novice 
- intermediate 
- advanced
- expert
10. quality 
- peer reviewed 
- non-reviewed]
11. tbd (use this keyword for resources we need to revisit)
12. exclude (use this keyword and then add the reason/topic - e.g. exclude, algorithm development)


# Metrics for Success 
(Aims during the initial hackathon event August 15-19, 2022)
1) Identify and describe at least 25 relevant curricular resources to inform the iHARP community (in progress)
2) Setup, test, and modify the iHARP KMT Taxonomy in Ontosoft with the initial group of resources (complete)

# Next Steps: 
1) Expand registered resources to better reflect Polar and Data Science resources. 
2) Complete a preliminary survey of existing tools and resources to create a collection for review/discussion with iHARP researchers
3) Test out and revise the preliminary taxonomy with an expanded collection of resources. 
4) Define where special cases belong within the Taxonomy. Examples to consider include pre-existing platforms with developed resources and communities such as the Arctic Sea Ice News & Analysis and SERC Carleton for Geosciences Curricular Materials. 
5) Document ideas for Ontosoft modifications to better serve the goals of the iHARP KMR. This may include modifying the underlying ontology, labels on the interface, and exploring ways to create APIs that could autopopulate some fields for new resources.
