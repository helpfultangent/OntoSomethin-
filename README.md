# # OntoSomethin-
This is the repository for the OntoSomethin' Hackathon Team for the ISGEO and iHARP Annual 2022 Workshop

# Goal of the OntoSomethin' Project: 
Create a Knowledge Management Registry (KMR) of Polar and Data Science resources to support the iHARP and ISGEO research communities. 
The KMR will Prioritize Spatio-temporal Materials for Education from the perspective of both AI and Polar Domains

# Activities: 
1) Set up and Initial Taxonomy or Framework to categorize and label entries in the registry. 
2) Identified possible collections of AI and educational materials





# iHARP KMT Taxonomy (preliminary)
Keywords or Labels used in Ontosoft entries: 
Categories [Tools, Teaching materials, Tutorials]
Domain Problem [ice sheet melting; spatio-temporal; sea ice; etc.]
Data [benchmark; observational]
Model [Empirical; Physics-based]
Approach/Method [examples, Quantitative, Qualitative ]
CI Resources
Primary Area [AI, Data Science, Polar Science]
Expertise [Novice; Intermediate; Advanced; Expert]
Quality [Peer reviewed, non-reviewed]


# Metrics for Success 
(Aims during the initial hackathon event August 15-19, 2022)
1) Identify and describe at least 25 relevant curricular resources to inform the iHARP community (in progress)
2) Setup, test, and modify the iHARP KMT Taxonomy in Ontosoft with the initial group of resources (complete)

# Next Steps: 
1) Expand registered resources to better reflect Polar and Data Science resources.
